# Election Analysis

This is an analysis project based on Data from the 2012 election.
We'll analyze 2 datasets, one with the results of political polls, and the other one with donations.

For the first dataset we'll try to answer some questions like:

- Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
- did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?
- how do undecided voters affect the poll?
- can we account for the undecided voters?
- how did voter sentiment change over time?
- can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

The second dataset is about the results of donations.
The donor's dataset can be found on the following link:

Some of the questions that we can answer are:

- how much was donated and what was the average donation?
- how did the donations differ between candidates?
- how did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?
- what were the demographics of the donors?
- is there a pattern to donation amounts?
